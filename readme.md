INTRODUCTION:

Hello :)  Aman Dubey and Ravi Morya are teaming up for our Backend project and have come up with a great idea for pet lovers. 

We will be creating a web app where we can search for the pets and buy them online. Also the pet-shop owner can keep track of the pet sold and in inventory.  

WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO BUILD?
