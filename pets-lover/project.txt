We had made a petlover App where we can check the pets available and 
in further update will be adding buying and adoption option as well.


Homepage:
In Home page we have addded the follwing feature

Home
login
signup
Dogbreeds
Cat breeds
Admin login 


Sign up page will let user sign up for the website and there a option to 
login with google and facebook added for future development

All the user data will be added to Mongo atlas 

cat breed and Dog breed we have used cat and dog api to render the data
where the details of each breed will be provided.

once the user has logged in it will take to the buying and check option

where user can add pet in car and buy (payment option will be added in future)


Diffrent Api has been created for pets, user, admin and given the acesss 
accordingly 

there is much more to do but the time allowed us to complete only that much.
